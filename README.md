## purpose of this repository
A backup of a web services project I did for a college class.
Only I used Ruby on Rails, while everyone else did it in PHP.

## If you clone my project..
-> bin/rails db:migrate

## If you want to use a domain on this server
rails s -p [port_number] -b [domain_name]
example -> rails s -p 80 -b rollersm.duckdns.org
